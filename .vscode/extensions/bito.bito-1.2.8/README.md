<h2><b>FAQs</b></h2>

<details>

<summary> 
<b>What is the cost of Bito?</b>

</summary>
<p>
Bito provides the following <a href="https://bito.ai/pricing/">pricing options</a> to suit your needs:
</p>
<p>
1. <b>Forever Free Plan</b>: This plan is entirely free to use. You get limited access (20 AI requests per day) to GPT-3.5 and similar models (such as Anthropic Claude Instant and some of Google‚Äôs new models like Chat-bison), also known as the Basic AI model. 
</p>
<p>
2. <b>10X Developer Plan</b>: Our 10X developer plan unlocks a world of possibilities, offering extensive access to the Advanced AI models such as GPT-4. It also includes access to Bito's advanced features along with expanded prompts and responses. 
</p>


</details>
<details><summary> 
<b>Does Bito store my code?</b>
</summary>
<p>Security and privacy were foremost on our minds when building Bito. Bito does not store any of your code, we only store metadata including file names and line numbers. All messages and metadata are encrypted in transit and encrypted at rest. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@bito.ai">support@bito.ai</a> if you would like to provide your own keys for encryption or discuss other options.

<b>What security measures does Bito employ?</b>
</summary>
<p>Security and privacy were foremost on our minds when building Bito. We do not store or view any of your code ever. All messages and metadata are encrypted in transit and encrypted at rest. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@bito.ai">support@bito.ai</a> if you would like to provide your own keys for encryption or discuss other options.

</details>
<details><summary> 
<b>What models does Bito use to generate responses?</b>
</summary>
<p>Users on the <a href="https://bito.ai/pricing/">10X developer plan</a> plan can initiate conversations with either Basic AI Models (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude Instant, etc.) or more Advanced AI Models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 1.3, Claude 2, etc.). Users of the Forever Free plan have access to Basic AI Models, specifically GPT-3.5, Google's chat-bison and other similar models. <a href="https://docs.bito.ai/feature-guides/basic-advanced-ai-models"> Know more</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Note: Our internal testing has shown that the output quality for simple and short prompts is not very different between 3.5 and 4. The full benefit of GPT-4 is realized in complex, long prompts or when prompts are related to niche facts that models are likely to hallucinate. Bito has not seen "hallucination" as a major issue for the development-related use cases that it is targeting.

<summary> 
<b>How to manually re-load in case VS Code does not prompt to re-load IDE after installing the Bito extension?</b>
</summary>

<p>Sometimes while installing/re-installing the same version of the Bito extension (*.vsix-1.x.x) which was already in use, VS Code may not prompt to re-load the VS Code editor. To manually solve for this do the following:
</p>
<p>
- Open the command palette ( Ctrl + Shift + P ) and execute the command: >Reload Window.
</p>
<p>
- OR Use command key Alt+F4 to close the window Or, Select Close Window from the File menu and re-open VS Code editor
