{"agents":[{"name":"localCodeAnswers","version":"1.0.0","description":"Local code search is useful when one wants to answer questions about the code, which is already developed and one may want to improve the code. It also helps in generating new code based on existing code. The local code can include everything from the initial project setup to the latest incremental changes. A local code typically includes application code, test code, build scripts, and more. By answering questions related to the local code, one can more easily understand the system function, classes, imports, exports, variables and functionality. Such question & answer session would help users to make enhancements, apply bug fixes and build new features.Some Example inputs are: LocalCodeAnswers List code changes for adding parameters x to function y, LocalCodeAnswers generate code in C for crud operations for struct abc, LocalCodeAnswers list all the REST APIs in the code.","callback":"callbackAnswerSearch"}]}
